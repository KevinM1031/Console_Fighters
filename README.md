My very first video game created with an actual programming language. DO NOT READ CODE. This is a luck-based player vs entity combat game, where the player must kill an enemy to progress and fight another, stronger enemy. There are multiple kits with different abilities, and each progression allows the player to choose an upgrade themselves. Added a GUI later on because nobody likes to play a game on a terminal window.
